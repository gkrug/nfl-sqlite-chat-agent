## üèóÔ∏è Agent Architecture

### Flow Overview

The agent uses a sophisticated multi-stage approach to provide accurate answers:

```
1. Keyword Filter (Stage 1)
   ‚Üì
2. LLM Query Classifier (Stage 2) - Only if Stage 1 inconclusive
   ‚Üì
3. Parallel SQL and Web Execution
   ‚Üì
4. Rating and Selecting Best Answer
```

### Detailed Flow

#### **Stage 1: Keyword Pre-screening**
- **Purpose**: Fast filtering for obvious NFL vs non-NFL cases
- **Method**: `_stage1_keyword_pre_screen()`
- **Logic**: Checks for core NFL terms (team names, players, football terms) vs obvious non-NFL terms
- **Output**: `(is_relevant, reason, is_conclusive)`

#### **Stage 2: LLM Classifier**
- **Purpose**: Only used when Stage 1 is inconclusive
- **Method**: `_stage2_llm_classifier()`
- **Logic**: Minimal LLM call with simple Y/N response for edge cases
- **Output**: `(is_relevant, reason)`

#### **Stage 3: Parallel Execution**
- **Purpose**: Run both database and web search simultaneously
- **Method**: `run_query_hybrid()` with `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **Database**: `_run_database_query()` - SQL queries against nflfastR_pbp table
- **Web Search**: `_run_web_search()` - Web search for current NFL information

#### **Stage 4: Answer Selection**
- **Purpose**: Score and select the best answer
- **Method**: `_score_answer()`
- **Scoring Factors**:
  - Base score (10 points)
  - Length bonus (5 points for 50-500 chars)
  - Specificity bonus (3 points for NFL terms)
  - Number presence (2 points for stats)
  - Source credibility (5 points for database, 3 for reputable web sources)
  - Penalties for implausible numbers, coaching questions, low confidence phrases

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | Your Together AI API key | Required |
| `DB_PATH` | Path to SQLite database | `data/pbp_db` |
| `SCHEMA_FILE` | Path to schema context file | `schema_context.txt` |

### Agent Settings

The agent uses multiple optimized LLMs for different tasks:

```python
# Database queries and SQL generation
self._llm = Together(
    model="mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1",
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=2048,
    together_api_key=api_key
)

# Web search synthesis and complex reasoning
self._web_llm = Together(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf",
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=2048,
    together_api_key=api_key
)

# Fast classification (minimal tokens)
self._classifier_llm = Together(
    model="mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1",
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=3,  # Very small for Y/N responses
    together_api_key=api_key
)
```

- **Parallel execution** runs database and web search simultaneously
- **Smart filtering** uses two-stage approach for NFL relevance
- **Answer scoring** selects the best response from multiple sources

## ‚ö° Performance

- **Keyword filtering**: ~0.01s (instant pre-screening)
- **LLM classification**: ~0.5s (only for inconclusive cases)
- **Parallel execution**: ~2-3s (both database and web search simultaneously)
- **Answer scoring**: ~0.1s (comprehensive quality assessment)
- **Total response time**: ~2-4s for most queries

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Custom Tools**: Add new LangChain tools in `agent.py`
2. **UI Enhancements**: Modify the Streamlit interface in `app.py`
3. **Schema Updates**: Run `python explore.py` to regenerate schema context
4. **Field Descriptions**: Run `Rscript getDescriptions.R` to update field descriptions

### Database Exploration

Use the `explore.py` script to extract and update the database schema:

```bash
python explore.py
```

### Field Descriptions

Generate enhanced field descriptions with data types:

```bash
Rscript getDescriptions.R
```

This creates `schema/field_descriptions.json` with comprehensive field documentation.

### Debugging

The application provides comprehensive debug output:
- **Agent Reasoning**: See the step-by-step thought process
- **SQL Queries**: View the generated SQL statements
- **Error Logs**: Detailed error messages and stack traces
